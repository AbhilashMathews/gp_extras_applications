# Multidimensional adaptive Gaussian process regression

To get started, here is a link to the original [gp_extras package](https://github.com/jmetzen/gp_extras) which should be installed along with [scikit-learn (sklearn)](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn). These packages and listed scripts are developed with Python 3 compatibility. 

The multidimensional adaptive Gaussian process code is applied on experimental data with a few examples of potential outputs displayed below. Corresponding codes necessary for the creation of similar plots can be found [here](https://github.com/AbhilashMathews/gp_extras_applications/tree/master/codes). The primary capability of this tool is the fitting of noisy multidimensional data as visualized below for both electron density and temperature measurements. This can yield time-varying plasma profiles and corresponding gradients with uncertainties.

(Note for users: GP regression cannot fix the observed data, e.g. outliers at Ïˆ < 0.95 towards the core breaking monotonicity. Good measurements with preprocessing will correspondingly help provide good fits, and the GP will help quantify what is already captured. Additionally, it is worth noting that running the same fitting routine on identical data sets can yield different results due to the stochastic optimization process employed.)
